## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- jQuery

### What I learned
In this Challenge, I learn :
1. How to relate between CSS Media Query with Javascript using "window.innerWidth : ? :"

### Continued development
In the future, I still want to refine this code.
Currently, I used 2 different buttons to perform 2 actions :
1. first button to show and hide "share-link" pop-up
2. second button to show and hide the profile

I still want to find a way to make this issue more efficient
